# Deploy

Initially using instructions from [here](https://gregrickaby.blog/article/nextjs-github-pages)

Deployment happens with any push to master

The [official instructions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/gh-pages) require an extra step, so lets be lazy and not bother.

# Nextra/MDX sad times

Originally used [this template](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/nextra-blank-custom-theme) which used nextra.

However, switched to using [this](https://github.com/ebenezerdon/nextjs-mdx-blog) ([blog]([this](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2021/10/building-a-blog-with-next-js-and-mdx/).
without MDX as MDX was too temperamental/confusing to integrate into the build system.
