# Deploy

Initially using instructions from [here](https://gregrickaby.blog/article/nextjs-github-pages)

Moved to not using nextra as too much was going on behind the scenes, following [this](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2021/10/building-a-blog-with-next-js-and-mdx/).

Deployment happens with any push to master

The [official instructions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/gh-pages) require an extra step, so lets be lazy and not bother.
