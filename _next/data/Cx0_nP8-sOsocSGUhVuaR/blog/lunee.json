The simulated gravity/physics especially.</p>\n<p>This is buggy and incomplete, but the library <a href=\"https://libgdx.com/\">LibGDX</a> allows online release, so I figured why not. If I get around to it, I'll fix up the graphics (I really dislike the color scheme) and iron out the creases. Head to the <a href=\"/games\" >games</a> section to check it out.</p>"},"__N_SSG":true}
