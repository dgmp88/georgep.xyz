It was on Android, but it was frustrating to keep up with changing terms and conditions and requirements of the Google Play Store.</p>\n<p>Instead, here it is in html. Some features don't work (e.g. leaderboard) and it may be a little buggy, but it's nice to have it playable somewhere. Head to the <a href=\"/games\" >games</a> section to check it out.</p>"},"__N_SSG":true}
