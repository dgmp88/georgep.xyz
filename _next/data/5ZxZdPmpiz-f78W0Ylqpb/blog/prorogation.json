Conveniently, the House of Lords recently released <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/LLN-2019-0111#fullreport\">this</a> dataset which should make it pretty easy to work out.</p>\n<h1 id=\"prorogationlengthssince1950\">Prorogation Lengths since 1950</h1>\n<p>The plot below shows the parliamentary session end date on the x axis, and the length it was prorogued for, in days, on the y axis. I've gone with since 1950 as the data looks quite different before then and the politics of over 6 decades ago doesn't feel particularly relevant today. I've also excluded prorogations that were to allow for a general election. When there's a general election, parliament is typically prorogued for a fair bit longer, but there isn't an election this time so it seems reasonable to leave them out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"650em\" src=\"/iframes/prorogation_not_election.html\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>The far right bar is the current prorogation. OK, it's a pretty big bar and certainly the biggest one on there. Here's another way to compare: the average prorogation lengths since 1950, next to this prorogations length:</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"650em\" src=\"/iframes/prorogation_barchart.html\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>So, that plot shows the current prorogation is a fair chunk bigger than you're average. A bit more than 6 times bigger.</p>\n<h1 id=\"outliers\">Outliers</h1>\n<p>In statistics we often talk about outliers. Outliers are data that lie outside our normal range, and there a bit tricky to define but there are a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Definitions_and_detection\">few ways</a>. One I use a fair bit at work is IQR outlier detection, AKA <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey's_fences\">Tukey's Fences</a>. If we take this definition, the current prorogation is 'far out' as it's more than 3x the IQR from the upper quartile (it's 13.5x away). However, it's a bit tricky and in fairness, there have been other prorogations before this one that were also 'far out', if not this far.</p>\n<p>Another way to think about it is the previous longest prorogation was 20 days, and this one is 33 - making it 65% longer than the longest prorogation since 1950.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This progation is unusually long <em>as well as</em> unusually timed.</p>\n<p>ðŸ¤”</p>\n<p>Fishy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sources\">Sources</h3>\n<p>You can see how this was calculated and a couple more plots <a href=\"https://github.com/dgmp88/dgmp88.github.io/tree/master/notebook/Prorogation.ipynb\">here</a>.</p>"},"__N_SSG":true}
