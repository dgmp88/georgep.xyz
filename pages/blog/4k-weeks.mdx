I really enjoyed the book [Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Kurkeman](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Time-How/dp/1847924018), the similarly-themed [WaitButWhy post by Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html), and the [What Are You Doing With Your Life? video by Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXeJANDKwDc).

Inspired by the Kurzgesagt [Calendar Of Your Life](https://shop-eu.kurzgesagt.org/collections/posters/products/lifespan-calendar-poster?variant=39593533735101) I thought I'd try to make my own poster (WIP). In the mean time though here's an interactive and terrifying visualisation of how long you've got left (assuming you live till 80).
