title: 'The Douchebag Huel Challenge'
date: 2024/09/15

A buddy and I had a beer and were curious what it'd be like to live off Huel for a week. We set ourselves these goals: 

1. Only eat Huel 
2. Don't drink any alcohol

We were curious on the impact on 

- Weight
- Excercise ability 
- Poop quality 
- Sleep quality
- Energy levels 
- Anything else? 

## Why is this interesting? 

1. My macros are imperfect, partly as I'm vegetarian - many meals are pretty carb heavy (pasta, pizza, etc). Huel claims to have optimal macros. So with Huel I should 
    - Hit protein targets much more frequently.
    - Get healthy fats (most of the fat I eat is from cooking oils, a peanut butter addiction, cheese, etc)
2. My baseline food is reasonably health, but not amazing. I eat out rather a lot (2x lunches, 2-3x dinners a week), which tends to be pretty unhealthy - rich, salty. My default lunch at home is baked beans on toast - OK, but not amazing. My dinners at home are often carb rich (e.g. pasta + vegetables). 
3. Huel also has lots of micros that I might be somewhat low on (e.g. omega 3's, prevalent in fish, less so in veggie food). 

## Instant Failure
I failed on 'only eat Huel' on day 1 as my amazing wife brought back some delicious rosette from Italy, so I changed the rules to 'have 2 Huel meals a day'.

I failed on don't drink alcohol on days 4 and 6 because my social life has a worrying focus on going to pubs.

# Eventual Methods

I mostly went for [Huel Black](https://uk.huel.com/products/nav-huel-black-edition). I tend to buy this as it has more protein. Given my relatively low protein veggie diet, I think makes sense to compensate. 

I had 4 store bought 'ready to drink', which is the default one without extra protein, when I didn't want to carry 2 extra portions to work. 

I had at least 1,000 calories from Huel each day, and often more - e.g. on the first day I had 1,800 calories per day.

I started on 05/09/2024 and ended 11/09/2024. 

# Results 


## Weight 

I gained weight, 68.4 -> 70.8kg. I was surprised by this, I expected to lose it. Hard to say if it's fat or muscle. My weight fluctuates a lot, so I'm not reading much into this. I did feel full more, so it's possible I was just consuming more calories.

## Exercise ability 

I felt stronger - I squatted heavier than I have for the last 6 months, and had some of my fastest casual runs over the last 6 months.

There are only 4 data points there, so the boxplot is a tad grandiose. 2 runs were bog standard. But my 2 fastest runs in the last 3 months were during that week. 

They weren't shorter than usual runs too, so I wasn't just doing short sprints.

I suspect this is a very strong placebo effect, but if it works I don't care. There could be other confounds in here too - e.g. sleeping well the night before, having a couple of easy runs in there.


## Poop Quality 
#### Trigger warning: shit talk

- I had 2x one wipe wonders. These are very rare for me.
- They seemed darker than usual. Weird. 
- No noticeable change to frequency, though I didn't track it.

## Sleep quality 

I felt like I was sleeping a bit worse the week of the challenge, but similarly the week or two before, so I don't think it was causal. The distribution looks pretty similar.

The awful nights at the bottom are caused by drinking alcohol that night. This always shows up very strongly on Garmin. 


## Energy Levels 

I regret not tracking this better with some kind of check-in score, but I think I felt pretty good most of the week. Not sure really any better/worse than usual though. 

According to Garmin, my 'Body Battery' was within range, but possibly worse than usual.

<p class="text-xs">As above, but lowest for a day.</p>

This could be impacted by running further/faster too, as it does take activity into account.

## Anything else? 

### Mental acuity 
I felt reasonably sharp this week, but I'm not sure much change from usual.

### Stomach feeling 
My stomach often felt heavy, in a not-awful but not-pleasant way. Not quite like a big meal, more like there was something sitting in it. I think I'm not used to that much protein.

### Convenience 
Not thinking about breakfast / lunch was pretty good. I may have run further than usual at lunch as I knew I could just drink Huel at my desk and not miss more work. 

### Cost 
If at the office I'll spend £8-12 on lunch 2x / week. ~2 Huel portions would be equivalent, which is ~£3.34. 

If at home:
Lunch example: Beans on toast might cost £0.40 beans, £0.38 bagel, £0.35 cheese, then a £0.16 banana  = £1.29
Breakfast example: Greek yoghurt £0.44, strawberries: £0.62 = £1.06

So Huel is a bit more expensive. I'm a bit surprised by this.

# Summary

- I felt stronger, which is likely placebo, but even if it is - still a win! 2 fast runs, 2 strong weights sessions felt great. 
- Poops improved.
- Evening meals are a social opportunity with friends and family, and usually the most delicious meal of the day. Very hard to skip, and even if physically healthier they're a joy I don't want to miss out on. Breakfast and lunch I generally care less about, though work lunches are social (and often delicious) too.

Overall, I think I'll stick to trying to increase my Huel intake - aiming for the majority of breakfasts and lunches.
