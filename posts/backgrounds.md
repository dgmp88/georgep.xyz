I wanted to make a nice background for my company page recently. There are some background designers out there, but they often charge if you want the SVG form.

I like the popular tesselated triangles background you often see around. Here's my take on that - you can play in the iframe below, or go [here](/triangles) if you want it full screen.

<iframe width="100%" height="800px" src="/triangles" frameborder="0"></iframe>
