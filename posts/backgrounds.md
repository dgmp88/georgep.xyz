I wanted to make a nice background for my company page recently. There are some background designers out there, but they often charge if you want the SVG form.

Here some easy ways to generate nice backgrounds. You can play in the iframe below, or go [here](/backgrounds) if you want it full screen for exporting.

<iframe width="100%" height="800px" src="/backgrounds" frameborder="0"></iframe>
