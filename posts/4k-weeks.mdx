I really enjoyed the book [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Time-How/dp/1847924018) by Oliver Burkeman, the similarly-themed [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) post by Tim Urban, and the [What Are You Doing With Your Life?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXeJANDKwDc) video by Kurzgesagt.

Inspired by the Kurzgesagt [Calendar Of Your Life](https://shop-eu.kurzgesagt.org/collections/posters/products/lifespan-calendar-poster?variant=39593533735101) poster I thought I'd try to make my own poster (WIP). In the mean time though here's an terrifying visualisation of how long you've got left (assuming you live till 80).
