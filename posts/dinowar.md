I made Dinowar years back with my friend [David](https://www.dglencross.com/) and excellent graphics from another friend [Emile](https://emile.work). It was on Android, but it was frustrating to keep up with changing terms and conditions and requirements of the Google Play Store.

Instead, here it is in html. Some features don't work (e.g. leaderboard) and it may be a little buggy, but it's nice to have it playable somewhere.
