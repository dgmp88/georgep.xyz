Conveniently, the House of Lords recently released <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/LLN-2019-0111#fullreport" parentName="p">this</a> dataset which should make it pretty easy to work out.</p><h1>Prorogation Lengths since 1950</h1><p>The plot below shows the parliamentary session end date on the x axis, and the length it was prorogued for, in days, on the y axis. I&#x27;ve gone with since 1950 as the data looks quite different before then and the politics of over 6 decades ago doesn&#x27;t feel particularly relevant today. I&#x27;ve also excluded prorogations that were to allow for a general election. When there&#x27;s a general election, parliament is typically prorogued for a fair bit longer, but there isn&#x27;t an election this time so it seems reasonable to leave them out.</p><iframe width="100%" height="650em" src="/iframes/prorogation_not_election.html" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>The far right bar is the current prorogation. OK, it&#x27;s a pretty big bar and certainly the biggest one on there. Here&#x27;s another way to compare: the average prorogation lengths since 1950, next to this prorogations length:</p><iframe width="100%" height="650em" src="/iframes/prorogation_barchart.html" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>So, that plot shows the current prorogation is a fair chunk bigger than you&#x27;re average. A bit more than 6 times bigger.</p><h1>Outliers</h1><p>In statistics we often talk about outliers. Outliers are data that lie outside our normal range, and there a bit tricky to define but there are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Definitions_and_detection" parentName="p">few ways</a>. One I use a fair bit at work is IQR outlier detection, AKA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey&#x27;s_fences" parentName="p">Tukey&#x27;s Fences</a>. If we take this definition, the current prorogation is &#x27;far out&#x27; as it&#x27;s more than 3x the IQR from the upper quartile (it&#x27;s 13.5x away). However, it&#x27;s a bit tricky and in fairness, there have been other prorogations before this one that were also &#x27;far out&#x27;, if not this far.</p><p>Another way to think about it is the previous longest prorogation was 20 days, and this one is 33 - making it 65% longer than the longest prorogation since 1950.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This progation is unusually long <em parentName="p">as well as</em> unusually timed.</p><p>ðŸ¤”</p><p>Fishy.</p><h3>Sources</h3><p>You can see how this was calculated and a couple more plots <a href="https://github.com/dgmp88/dgmp88.github.io/tree/master/notebook/Prorogation.ipynb" parentName="p">here</a>.</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/blog/prorogation","query":{},"buildId":"5VWtMiEOpPMYHMDIVd3P2","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
