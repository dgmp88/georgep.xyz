We set ourselves these goals: </p>
<ol>
<li>Only eat huel </li>
<li>Don't drink any alcohol</li>
</ol>
<p>We were curious on the impact on </p>
<ul>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Excercise ability </li>
<li>Poop quality </li>
<li>Sleep quality</li>
<li>Energy levels </li>
<li>Anything else? </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whyisthisinteresting">Why is this interesting?</h2>
<ol>
<li>My macros are imperfect, partly as I'm vegetarian - many meals are pretty carb heavy (pasta, pizza, etc). Huel claims to have optimal macros. So with Huel I should <ul>
<li>Hit protein targets much more frequently.</li>
<li>Get healthy fats (most of the fat I eat is from cooking oils, a peanut butter addiction, cheese, etc)</li></ul></li>
<li>My baseline food is reasonably health, but not amazing. I eat out rather a lot (2x lunches, 2-3x dinners a week), which tends to be pretty unhealthy - rich, salty. My default lunch at home is baked beans on toast - OK, but not amazing. My dinners at home are often carb rich (e.g. pasta + vegetables). </li>
<li>Huel also has lots of micros that I might be somewhat low on (e.g. omega 3's, prevalent in fish, less so in veggie food). </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="instantfailure">Instant Failure</h2>
<p>I failed on 'only eat huel' on day 1 as my amazing wife brought back some delicious rosette from Italy, so I changed the rules to 'have 2 Huel meals a day'.</p>
<p><img src='/images/rossette.jpg' /></p>
<p class="text-xs">Not my rosette, which was mushroom. Image from <a href="https://www.tinastable.com/rosette-al-forno/">Tinas Table</a>. Rosette are amazing, go make them. </p>
<p>I failed on don't drink alcohol on days 4 and 6 because my social life has a worrying focus on going to pubs.</p>
<h1 id="eventualmethods">Eventual Methods</h1>
<p>I mostly went for <a href="https://uk.huel.com/products/nav-huel-black-edition">Huel Black</a>. I tend to buy this as it has more protein. Given my relatively low protein veggie diet, I think makes sense to compensate. </p>
<p>I had 4 store bought 'ready to drink', which is the default one without extra protein, when I didn't want to carry 2 extra portions to work. </p>
<p>I had at least 1,000 calories from Huel each day, and often more - e.g. on the first day I had 1,800 calories per day.</p>
<p>I started on 05/09/2024 and ended 11/09/2024. </p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
<p>I gained weight, 68.4 -&gt; 70.8kg. I was surprised by this, I expected to lose it. Hard to say if it's fat or muscle. My weight fluctuates a lot, so I'm not reading much into this. I did feel full more, so it's possible I was just consuming more calories.</p>
<h2 id="exerciseability">Exercise ability</h2>
<p>I felt stronger - I squatted heavier than I have for the last 6 months, and had some of my fastest casual runs over the last 6 months. </p>

<p class="text-xs">Annoying 'mins per kilometer with fractional minutes'. e.g. 5:20 min / km = 5.33 (20s/60s = 0.33). Plotly doesn't handle min/km well.</p>
<p>There are only 4 data points there, so the boxplot is a tad grandious. 2 runs were bog standard. But my 2 fastest runs in the last 3 months were during that week. </p>
<p>They weren't shorter than usual runs too, so I wasn't just doing short sprints. </p>
<iframe
  width="100%"
  height="500px"
  src="/iframes/huel_avg_dist.html"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
<p>I suspect this is a very strong placebo effect, but if it works I don't care. There could be other confounds in here too - e.g. sleeping well the night before, having a couple of easy runs in there.</p>
<h2 id="poopquality">Poop Quality</h2>
<h4 id="triggerwarningshittalk">Trigger warning: shit talk</h4>
<ul>
<li>I had 2x one wipe wonders. These are very rare for me.</li>
<li>They seemed darker than usual. Weird. </li>
<li>No noticeable change to frequency, though I didn't track it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sleepquality">Sleep quality</h2>
<p>I felt like I was sleeping a bit worse the week of the challenge, but similarly the week or two before, so I don't think it was causal. The distribution looks pretty similar. </p>

  frameborder="0"

<p class="text-xs">Sleep Score according to Garmin: A number taking into account duration, stress, and phases of sleep.</p>
<p>The awful nights at the bottom are caused by drinking alcohol that night. This always shows up very strongly on Garmin. </p>
<h2 id="energylevels">Energy Levels</h2>
<p>I regret not tracking this better with some kind of check-in score, but I think I felt pretty good most of the week. Not sure really any better/worse than usual though. </p>
<p>According to Garmin, my 'Body Battery' was within range, but possibly worse than usual.</p>
<iframe

<p class="text-xs">Body Battery according to Garmin: energy levels estimate, measured using HRV, stress, sleep quality and activity. This is the highest it ever hit for a day in/out of the challenge.</p>

  src="/iframes/huel_bb_low.html"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
<p class="text-xs">As above, but lowest for a day.</p>
<p>This could be impacted by running further/faster too, as it does take activity into account.</p>
<h2 id="anythingelse">Anything else?</h2>
<h3 id="mentalacuity">Mental acuity</h3>
<p>I felt reasonably sharp this week, but I'm not sure much change from usual.</p>
<h3 id="stomachfeeling">Stomach feeling</h3>
<p>My stomach often felt heavy, in a not-awful but not-pleasant way. Not quite like a big meal, more like there was something sitting in it. I think I'm not used to that much protein.</p>
<h3 id="convenience">Convenience</h3>
<p>Not thinking about breakfast / lunch was pretty good. I may have run further than usual at lunch as I knew I could just drink huel at my desk and not miss more work. </p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>If at the office I'll spend £8-12 on lunch 2x / week. ~2 huel portions would be equivalent, which is ~£3.34. </p>
<p>If at home:
Lunch example: Beans on toast might cost £0.40 beans, £0.38 bagel, £0.35 cheese, then a £0.16 banana  = £1.29
Breakfast example: Greek yoghurt £0.44, strawberries: £0.62 = £1.06</p>
<p>So Huel is a bit more expensive. I'm a bit surprised by this.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>I felt stronger, which is likely placebo, but even if it is - still a win! 2 fast runs, 2 strong weights sessions felt great. </li>
<li>Poops improved.</li>
<li>Evening meals are a social opportunity with friends and family, and usually the most delicious meal of the day. Very hard to skip, and even if physically healthier they're a joy I don't want to miss out on. Breakfast and lunch I generally care less about, though work lunches are social (and often delicious) too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I think I'll stick to trying to increase my Huel intake - aiming for the majority of breakfasts and lunches.</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"meta":{"title":"The Douchebag Huel Challenge","date":"2024/09/15"},"content":"\u003cp\u003eA buddy and I had a beer and were curious what it'd be like to live off Huel for a week.
