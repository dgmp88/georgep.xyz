For instance, say someone comes to you and offers you two bets:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Bet</th><th>Probability</th><th>Amount</th><th>Calculation</th><th>Expected Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>a</td><td>90%</td><td>£1,000,00</td><td>0.9 x £1,000,000</td><td>£900,000</td></tr><tr><td>b</td><td>10%</td><td>£1,000,000,000</td><td>0.1 x £1,000,000,000</td><td>£10,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can only pick one, which should you pick? In terms of expected value, option b is far higher.</p><p>However, what would you actually do might depend on a bunch more factors - your personal circumstances, your risk appetite, and how often you get to bet. Say you have average wealth, and you&#x27;re only offered this bet once. Personally I&#x27;d pick option a, as the higher probability of success is more appealing.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this in the context of career choices and listening to the <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 hours</a> podcast. They place a strong emphasis on making bets which have high expected value if only a low chance of success. On a societal level we definitely want people doing this to solve our big problems, but on an individual level I don&#x27;t think many people can function well on a career path where they honestly believe they have a 90% chance of failure, even if the payoff is potentially huge.</p><p>One mitigation of this might be that I think most people have a hard time really internalising odds. Starting my company I knew the oft touted (if never uncited) stat 9/10 startups fail. But even though I took this to mean my startup would have a high chance of failure, we all tend to think we&#x27;re special and can beat the odds.</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/blog/expected-value","query":{},"buildId":"czWy6EdkZuo_QLUTmipX-","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
